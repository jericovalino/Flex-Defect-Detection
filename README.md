# Flex-Defect-Detection

This is a project that utilize opensource machine learning and machine vision tools(Google's Tensorflow with OpenCV ) & models to assist in identifying cosmetic defects for electronic products.

#### The GUI of the application
To create the graphical user interface, I used Tkinter, the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installs of Python.
It uses widgets to create objects such as buttons, labels, frames and etc. To learn more about Tkinter and how to start creating simple GUI's with it, you can go to this [LINK](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/gui-tkinter-python#ITT)
