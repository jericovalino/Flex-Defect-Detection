# Flex-Defect-Detection

This is a project that utilize opensource machine learning and machine vision tools(Google's Tensorflow with OpenCV ) & models to assist in identifying cosmetic defects for electronic products.

#### The GUI of the application
To create the UI, I use Tkinter the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installs of Python.
